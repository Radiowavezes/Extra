You can think of packages as the directories on a file system and modules as files within directories, 
but don’t take this analogy too literally since packages and modules need not originate from the file system. 
For the purposes of this documentation, we’ll use this convenient analogy of directories and files. Like file system directories, 
packages are organized hierarchically, and packages may themselves contain subpackages, as well as regular modules.
